# Notes

- Will allow to buy those cars from the beginning. Remove single purchase restriction but removes game feature ...
Might be interesting to provide a revert patch for people not wanting to circumvent this!

- Changes value of field #9 (Reward_param_) in Achievements topic, for entries with field #1 (Achievement_Event_) for reward cars :
genuine value : <car id> , new value : 415 (non existing id, 0 should work as well).
